# Data Extraction

This repository contains code for extracting data from a specific webpage using Python's `requests` library and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping.

## Introduction

Data extraction from websites is a common task in various fields, including data analysis, research, and more. This code demonstrates how to extract information from a webpage and print the article title and text content.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4

2. Replace the `url` variable with the URL of the webpage you want to extract data from.

3. Run the Python script `data_extraction.py`.

4. The extracted article title and text will be displayed in the console.

## Code Explanation

- The `requests` library is used to send HTTP requests to the given URL.
- The HTML content of the webpage is parsed using `BeautifulSoup` to make it accessible for data extraction.
- The article title is extracted from the first `<h1>` element found on the page.
- The article text is extracted from `<div>` elements with the class `tdb-block-inner td-fix-index`.

## Dependencies

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): A Python library for making HTTP requests.
- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/): A library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

## Important Note

Web scraping should be done responsibly and ethically. Make sure to review the website's terms of use and robots.txt file before scraping its content. Always respect the website's policies and avoid causing any harm or disruption.
