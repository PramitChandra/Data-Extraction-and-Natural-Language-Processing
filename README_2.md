# Data-Extraction-and-Natural-Language-Processing
# Natural Language Processing Repository

This repository contains code for analyzing text data using Natural Language Processing techniques. The provided script demonstrates various analyses on a given text, including sentiment analysis, complexity analysis, and other text metrics using the TextBlob library and NLTK.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence focused on the interaction between computers and human language. This code showcases how to analyze text data using NLP techniques to extract valuable insights about sentiment, complexity, and other metrics.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install textblob nltk

2. Uncomment the lines for downloading NLTK resources if it's your first time using NLTK.

3. Replace the content of the `text` variable with the text you want to analyze.

4. Run the Python script `nlp_analysis.py`.

5. The script will display various metrics related to sentiment, complexity, word count, and more.

## Code Explanation

The provided Python script performs similar analyses as the previous example, utilizing NLP techniques:

- Sentiment analysis using `TextBlob` to determine polarity and subjectivity.
- Calculation of positive and negative sentiment scores.
- Tokenization of the text into sentences and words using `NLTK`.
- Average sentence length calculation.
- Counting the number of complex words using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.
- Calculation of the percentage of complex words.
- Fog index calculation for text readability.
- Average number of words per sentence calculation.
- Syllables count and average syllables per word calculation.
- Counting personal pronouns in the text.
- Average word length calculation.

## Dependencies

- [textblob](https://pypi.org/project/textblob/): A simple library for processing textual data.
- [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/): The Natural Language Toolkit, used for text analysis and processing.

## Important Note

Natural Language Processing is a vast field with numerous advanced techniques for analyzing and processing text. The code provided here is a basic demonstration and might not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases.
